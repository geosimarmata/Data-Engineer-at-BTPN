# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn for credit card services. By understanding the profiles and behaviors of customers who are likely to discontinue their services, the bank can proactively reach out, deliver enhanced services, and positively influence customer retention.

## Project Scenario

They seek assistance in profiling customers to predict those who are likely to leave their credit card services. This proactive approach will empower the company to reach out to these customers, deliver enhanced services, and positively influence their decisions.
